# day-planner

day planner application made with Luxon and JQuery


## Description

As a developer, we rely on a multitude of APIs in order to make our work simpler. APIs offer the functionality of an object retrievable database with the simple use of a CDN or plugin. Because APIs offer such a vast amount of immutable data for programmers to use in their applications, it is essential to learn how to read the documentation and implement them to increase efficiency. 

For this project, I will be building a day planner that utilizes Luxon in order to parse a user's location and current time. The application can be used as a powerful tool to help visualize one's schedules and improve organization. I chose Luxon due to its clear documentation, and the fact that it is a tried and true API that gives its users numerous methods that are a significant step up from Moment.js's functionality. Additionally, the day planner will also use local storage so that page refreshes do not impact the current planner's schedule.
